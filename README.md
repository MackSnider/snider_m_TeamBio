# Dynamic Team Page - Authoring 2 (MMED-1055)

This project was made for my authoring 2 class. This os a course in the Interactive Media Design program at Fanshawe College

## Motivation

I am a very motivated person. When I put my mind on most things I can usually accomplish any obstacle in my way. This was a fun project to work on. I was very motivated to make my new partner Aaron out of a stock image.

## Usage

This project could be used by anyone trying to figure out more information on me. You could also use this project as a reference when creating a fake partner. I'm glad Aaron could be a part of this.

## Credit

The credit goes all to me, Mackenzie Snider. Aaron might be a good-looking guy but unfortunately for me... he is not actually real and absolutely contributed nothing to the development of this project.
